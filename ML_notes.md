# Machine learning notes

Notes for machine learning concepts/theories that I encountered during the project.

* [cross entropy - information entropy = relative entropy (KL-divergence)](https://www.zhihu.com/question/41252833)

* [maximum likelihood extimation = argmin{cross extropy} = argmin{KL-divergence}](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/84764177)
