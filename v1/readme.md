# 3D Building vectorization v1

dsm refinement (GAN) --> edge detection (UResNet) --> building vectorization (graph)

1. go to folder `dsm` for dsm refinement

2. go to folder `edge` for edge detection

3. run `vectorize.py` for sample area vectorization

4. run `threshold.py` for sample area visualization and threshold evaulation

5. run `visualize.py` to draw vectorization result on orthophoto and dsm
